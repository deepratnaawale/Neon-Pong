# Neon-Pong
## A simple pong game with minimalistic graphics and AI.

Game Engine: Unity Game Engine

This is a simple 2D pong game inspired by the old Atari game. AI is not actually AI, its just simple coordinate maths.

It supports 2 player (just make UI for selecting 2 player mode in main menu, link it to game script and dont forget to define 2P controls in Unity!). 

There probably won't be any additions to the project as it was just a college project I took up on a whim.
