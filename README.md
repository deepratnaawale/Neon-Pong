# Neon-Pong
## A simple 2D pong game made in Unity 3D with minimalistic graphics and AI.


This is a simple 2D pong game inspired by the old Atari game. AI is not actually AI, its just simple coordinate maths.

It supports 2 player (just make UI for selecting 2 player mode in main menu, link it to game script and dont forget to define 2P controls in Unity!). 

There probably won't be any additions/ optimizations to the project as it was just a college project I took up on a whim.
